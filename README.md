This commit refines the classification of the ODD at the top level by defining three essential categories—scenery elements, environmental conditions, and dynamic elements—and referencing either import or amend directives for the relevant PKL files. It leverages ODD_template.pkl as the primary structure, while dyn_template.pkl, env_template.pkl, and scen_template.pkl can be imported to integrate additional details. The top_level_odd: ODD_template example in ODD_test.pkl contains unconfigured parameters that must be set to enable correct evaluation of the ODD. Further information on the PKL language is available at https://pkl-lang.org/index.html.
